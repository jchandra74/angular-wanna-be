#### How to Write AngularJS application to be more like Angular

## In Scope
Go through codes showing the folowings:
1. Starts with a simplistic AngularJS application (one html, inline JavaScript).
2. Refactored out the JavaScript into its own file.
3. Refactored the application according to [John Papa's Angular 1 Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md).
4. Refactored the application to use CommonJS like module loading syntax to be closer to Angular CLI generated application.
5. Refactored the application to use proper module loader (SystemJS).
6. Refactored the application to use TypeScript and proper ES2015 import / export syntax.
7. Introduced usage of experimental [decorator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html) to make the current application to look more like Angular.

**Goal:** files & folders structure and TypeScript that looks like Angular.
